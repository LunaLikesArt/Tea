## Intro

Born and raised in Germany. I moved to the US after [German high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_(school)) for a year to be immersed in English. My host family lived on campus at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA and we shared a dorm with 40 students. During that time I met my now-husband Scott (native Bostonian) but nothing could stop me from going to university in Germany. Fast forward 5 years long distance relationship across two continents and many trips to foreign countries later, I’m back in the US. Boston is my second home but deep down I’m an explorer and am currently living in the Rockies with my husband and two doodles, Oskar and Maude. 

I have many interests but always had a sweet spot for languages, science and riddles. I come from a big gamer family, when others went to the beach we played games (computer, board, card and dice). Try to beat me in a game of memory or puzzle! Out of curiosity I took a lot of things apart hoping to build my own robot. After a Gameboy and TV my parents kept a closer eye on our belongings. In 8th grade I founded an after school advanced math class in cooperation with my teacher (astronomical calculations and chess were top of the agenda) and in college I took some CS classes and started teaching 5th/6th graders the fundamentals of programming.
